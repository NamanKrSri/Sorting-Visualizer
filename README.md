# 🔷 Sorting Visualizer

An **interactive algorithm visualization engine** built entirely using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**.  
This project visually demonstrates how different sorting algorithms work step-by-step, allowing users to control speed, array size, and observe time complexity comparisons in real-time.

## 🧠 Features

- 🎚️ **Adjustable Array Size** – Change the number of bars dynamically.
- ⚡ **Speed Control** – Set the animation speed for better visualization.
- 🔄 **Generate New Array** – Instantly create a new random dataset.
- ▶️ **Start / Stop Controls** – Play or pause the sorting process anytime.
- 📊 **Complexity Display** – Shows best, average, worst, and space complexity for each algorithm.
- 🧩 **Clean UI** – Neon-themed interface with smooth transitions.

## 🧮 Supported Algorithms

| Algorithm | Time Complexity (Best) | Average | Worst | Space |
|------------|------------------------|----------|--------|--------|
| **Bubble Sort** | O(n) | O(n²) | O(n²) | O(1) |
| *(More algorithms can be added easily — like Selection, Insertion, Merge, Quick, etc.)* |
